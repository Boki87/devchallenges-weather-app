<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](screenshots/screen1.png)



### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

## Features

Visitor can see weather details provided by the [metaweather](https://www.metaweather.com/api/) api based on his geo position. Or search for any location and display the weather data.

The app saves the last selected location in localStorage so on the next visit that will be the default location to display the weather for.

Still some work left:
- [] Making it mobile friendly (responsive)
- [] Add more micro animations for better UX
